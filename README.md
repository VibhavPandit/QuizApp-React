##About This Project
I took upon this project to learn about react.js. This application is an interactive web application that allows users to take quizzes.

**Key Features:**
  
-User Authentication: The application first asks for username and password to continue with the test.
-Quiz Taking: Registered users can take quizzes, the app provides immediate feedback on correct and incorrect answers, and it keeps track of the user's score.
-Interactive: The app features an appealing and user-friendly design, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for quiz takers.

**Features I wanted to add:**
I want to add questions on the webpages for teachers. Teachers should be able to login and should be able to manipulate the questions, which is add or remove questions.
